> generate estimate of electricity cost and (i) report a average $/block (or something like that) in our results and 
(ii) enable  targeting of a range of that variable.

TODO:::
> FIX COST CALCULATION per block (hashrate * seconds between blocks * kwh/Th * $/kwh) ##
    > Baseline vs. Adjusted ##
> Change sweep minutes tot seconds ##
> Reward:: change to per block and multiply by exchange rate ##
> "Final Adjusted Hashrate" ##
> Sliding window on playground ##
> Block fee optional paramater (hard)
> Create bounds for elect cost and consumption along with hashrate ##
