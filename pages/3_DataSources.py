The data used in our model indicates several key trends:

1. **Long-term correlation** between Bitcoin price and hashrate remains strong, but with varying time lags.
2. **Mining efficiency improvements** have accelerated, with average efficiency improving approximately 20% year-over-year.
3. **Geographic shift** in mining operations from China to North America has affected the average electricity costs.
4. **Increased institutionalization** of mining has led to more predictable hashrate deployment patterns.

These trends help explain the accuracy and limitations of our prediction model.
